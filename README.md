## Why I chose Coursera Learning Platform? 

## 1. Engaging videos: 

Technical books can be dry and difficult to read, especially if you are not familiar with the material. Specializations, professional certificates, and courses often use engaging videos to explain concepts and illustrate how they are applied in real-world situations. This can make the material more accessible and easier to understand.

## 2. Real-world labs:
Specializations, professional certificates, and courses often include real-world labs where you can practice what you have learned. This is a great way to solidify your understanding of the material and to get hands-on experience with the skills you are learning.

## 3. Expert instruction:
Specializations, professional certificates, and courses are typically "taught by experts in the field". This means that you will be learning from people who have real-world experience and who can help you to understand the material in a way that is relevant to your career goals.

## 4. Community support: 
Specializations, professional certificates, and courses often have online communities where you can connect with other learners and ask questions. This can be a great way to get help and support as you are learning.

## 5. Accreditation: 
Specializations, professional certificates, and courses are often "accredited by reputable organizations" i.e top technology companies and top universities. This means that they meet certain standards of quality and that the credits you earn can be transferred to other programs thru "Degree Credit Eligibility" (future Bachelor's Degree or even advanced-degrees like Master of Arts (MA), Master of Science (MS), and Master of Business Administration (MBA), or used to qualify for jobs.

## 6. Founded by one of the Godfather of AI: 
The Coursera Learning Platform was founded by Professor Andrew Ng.
